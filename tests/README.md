# Tests Directory

This directory contains all test scripts for the vggt-dataset-builder project.

## Running Tests

### Using pytest (recommended)

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov

# Run a specific test file
pytest tests/test_bidirectional.py

# Run a specific test function
pytest tests/test_bidirectional.py::test_file_detection
```

### Running as scripts

Each test file can also be run directly as a Python script:

```bash
python tests/test_bidirectional.py
python tests/test_triplet_detection.py
```

## Test Files

- **test_bidirectional.py** - Tests for bidirectional file detection logic. Verifies that the system correctly identifies forward and reverse direction file pairs.

- **test_triplet_detection.py** - Tests for triplet detection logic. Verifies that complete image triplets (splats, reference, target) are correctly identified in scene directories.

- **test_validate_image.py** - Tests for image validation utilities. Verifies that corrupted, truncated, empty, and invalid image files are properly detected and rejected during dataset preparation. Covers critical error paths to prevent bad images from entering the training pipeline.

## Adding New Tests

1. Create a new test file in this directory following the naming convention `test_*.py`
2. Define test functions prefixed with `test_`
3. Run with `pytest` or as a script
4. Optionally mark tests with pytest markers:
   - `@pytest.mark.unit` for unit tests
   - `@pytest.mark.integration` for integration tests

Example:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.unit
def test_example():
    assert True
```

## Test Configuration

The pytest configuration is defined in `pyproject.toml` at the workspace root:

```toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
testpaths = ["tests"]
python_files = ["test_*.py", "*_test.py"]
python_functions = ["test_*"]
```
